# Proximity Isolation Forest

Proximity Isolation Forest (ProxIF) is an outlier detector which input are pairwise distances.

The example in main.m outputs the average AUC for the Zongker dataset; the used parametrization corresponds to the one named 'ProxIF-F' in the paper, i.e. the resulting AUC is that of Table 6.

Within the code you will find references to pseudocodes (X implements Line Y of Algorithm Z) presented in the Supplementary Material of a soon-to-be published manuscript.
